// The big file: Givens's behaviour, told in the order of its stories.
//
// Each story in capabilities/ that's moved here has a section, in the order of the
// capabilities folders. A section starts with a "// Feature: <name>" comment, the Feature's
// name word for word, and runs to the next one. Inside it, each of the Feature's Rules has a
// "// Rule: <name>" comment, in the Feature's order, and a "// Scenario: <name>" comment marks
// the code a scenario starts in where that helps a reader; several can share one piece of code.
// Code that two or more stories use is in big_helpers.go, so this file reads as the stories
// alone.
//
// TestBigFile in acceptance/ checks those comments against the feature files, and
// scripts/entry.sh finds the section for a Feature, Rule or Scenario name. The workflow is
// tasks/one-big-file/essay.md; the pilot is tasks/one-big-file/notes.md. The rest of
// internal/app isn't here yet.
//
// Code outside this file that a story depends on, and why it's elsewhere:
//   - internal/kit/givens.sh: bash, run in the developer's shell by every setup script.
//   - internal/tui, internal/termedit and cmd/givens: the edges. They import this package, so
//     moving them in would make it depend on Bubble Tea; their stories have pointer sections.
